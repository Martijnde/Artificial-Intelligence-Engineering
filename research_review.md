### Research review
Research review of the paper: Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search.
The paper is telling about a computer algorithm playing the game of "Go", it shows the goals before coding it, the path to succes and 
the paper is also summing up the great results the AplhaGo program archiefed online and offline.  

#### Summary of the paper's goals:
The goals of the program called "AlphaGo" to master the computer game named "Go" are listed below:

To introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks’ to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks’ to select moves.
To introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks.
To inform readers about their program AlphaGo achieving a 99.8% winning rate against other Go programs.
To inform readers about the fact that their program AlphaGo defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0


#### Summary of the paper's results:
The results mentioned in the paper about AlphaGo are listed below:

Their program AlphaGo achieved a stunning 99.8% winning rate against other Go programs.
This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go. 
Defeating a human professional player in the full-sized game of GO feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.
